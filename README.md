# Dispersion tests in generalised linear mixed-effects models - a methods comparison and practical guide

Code for the simulations and analyses of the study "Dispersion tests in generalised linear mixed-effects models - a methods comparison and practical guide".



Simulations were done sequentially with the scripts in "code_simulations". 

Results were stored in "data"

Results and figures were created with the scrips in "code_results" and figures were saved in "figures". 

In "functions_others" there are auxiliary functions used during simulations or results and example figures presented in the study manuscript.


An example HTML file of the different dispersion tests available in the package DHARMa are show in "dispersionTest_with_DHARMa.htm / .Rmd"
